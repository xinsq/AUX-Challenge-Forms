there is month and year but only one label
where to put legend/numbers- inside fieldset?
portfolio address
zoom in causes portfolio address to break

Where does the (1),(2), and (3) belong in the HTML?


let screen readers know that they can click on labels:
label {  
cursor:hand;  
}


border-right: 1px #ebebeb solid;
